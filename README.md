# Shef #

* Shef is a recipe storage application that utilizes version control to keep track of variations in recipe components for each particular dish

* Shef allows users to browse through recipes by searching or filtering based on a number of categories

* Once a user signs-up and is logged in are more components become accessible 

* These include being able to create original recipes as well create new versions of existing recipes 

* When the users view a recipe they can scroll through the versions and upon clicking on a particulatr version view the ingredients, cooking instructions and dietary resctrictions
